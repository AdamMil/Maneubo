Maneubo is a program that was originally intended to provide a kind of virtual maneuvering board. A maneuvering board is a specialized chart used to plot the motions of craft, compute intercept and avoidance courses, etc. Maneubo does not provide a true maneuvering board, and in fact I consider them to be more or less obsolete, but Maneubo dispenses with the chart and automates the calculations, allowing you to do the same kinds of things much more conveniently. It is intended to be used along with simulations (e.g. submarine simulations) as an aid, but as it contains the basics of a general vector-based plotting tool, it might be useful for other things. It's unfinished, but still kinda useful.
